            <h1>404 page works!<small> which is great, however</small></h1>
            <p>
                if you ended up on this page it means that whatever it was that you were looking for moved and is not in the same place anymore
            </p>
            <h4>
                <small>sorry for that</small></h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                my sugestion would be to either go to the home page by <a href="#">following this link</a>
                <br> or by using the button below
                <br>
                <br> or in case you were looking for some really important info you could <a href="mailto:rafszul@gmail.com">contact developers directly by email</a>
                <br> or you could inspect the link that lead you to this page and potentialy <a href="https://github.com/projekt-kreatywa/pomegranate-chat-ng2-md-fire/issues" target="_blank">let me know about findings of your invastigation via issues section on github</a>
                <br> whichever suits you
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                <small>sorry again</small>
            </h4>

            <a class="expanded large button" routerLink="/contact" routerLinkActive="is-active">Back to home page!</a>
